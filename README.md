# OmNomNom

This bot is not under active development anymore.
There is no official instance of this bot anymore. If you want to use it you
have to take the code from this repository and host it as a new bot instance.

OmNomNom is a Telegram bot that can tell you what you can eat in some canteens
in Berlin (Germany). I would like to support more canteens in other towns or
countries in the future. If you have any suggestions let me now.
You can invite the bot to a group or ask it directly.
