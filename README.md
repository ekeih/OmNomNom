# OmNomNom

OmNomNom is a Telegram bot that can tell you what you can eat in some canteens
in Berlin (Germany). I would like to support more canteens in other towns or
countries in the future. If you have any suggestions let me now.
You can invite the bot to a group or ask it directly.

## How to use it
Usually you do not need to run the bot yourself. You can just talk to the
@OmnBot in Telegram. Feel free to invite it to your groups.

## Developer & Maintainer
* Max Rosin

## Contributer
Thanks to everyone who contributed code or documentation improvements to the
bot.

* Christian Beneke
* Matthias Loibl

If you want to add canteens or features to the bot or want to fix some bug feel
free to open a GitHub issue and start hacking :-) Pull Requests are very
wellcome! If you found some problem or would like to see a new feature or more
canteens but are not able (or do not want to / do not have the time) please
also open an issue at GitHub and/or talk to me via Telegram (@ekeih).
