# OmNomNom

OmNomNom is a Telegram bot that can tell you what you can eat in some canteens
in Berlin (Germany). You can invite the bot to a group or ask it directly.

Usually you do not need to run the bot yourself. You can just talk to the
@OmnBot in Telegram. Feel free to invite it to your groups.

The project was originally created by [ekeih/OmNomNom](https://github.com/ekeih/OmNomNom) but is now maintained by members of the Freitagsrunde, a student organization at TU Berlin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is not under active development anymore. The recommended fork is [Freitagsrunde/OmNomNom](https://github.com/Freitagsrunde/OmNomNom).
> The official bot instance @OmnBot is also using the code of the fork.
